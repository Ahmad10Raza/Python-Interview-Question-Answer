    "# 32. What is the purpose of the `__str__` method in Python classes?\n",
    "The `__str__` method is a special method in Python classes that returns a string representation\n",
    "of an object. It is often used to provide a more readable and informative string representation of\n",
    "the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__str__` method in Python classes is used to return a human-readable string representation of an object. This method is called by the built-in `print()`, `str()`, and `format()` functions. If you don't define a `__str__` method for a class, then the built-in object implementation calls the `__repr__` method instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__str__` method can be used to customize the way that objects are displayed in print statements, logs, and other places where strings are used to represent objects. For example, you could use the `__str__` method to return a string that includes the name of the object, the values of its attributes, or other information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a `__str__` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __str__(self):\n",
    "        return f\"Person(name={self.name}, age={self.age})\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "person = Person(\"John Doe\", 30)\n",
    "print(person)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will print the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Person(name=John Doe, age=30)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the `__str__` method in the `Person` class returns a string that includes the name and age of the `person` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__str__` method is a powerful tool that can be used to customize the way that objects are displayed in Python. By carefully defining the `__str__` method for your classes, you can make it easier for users to understand and interact with your code."
